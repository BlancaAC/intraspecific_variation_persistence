# Data and code for: Integrating intraspecific variation into population dynamics reveals how interacting species persist in mutualistic communities

All data and code necessary to replicate the results of the theoretical testing and empirical case study are available in this repository. The /Data folder contains .csv files with the plantâ€“pollinator matrix, plant traits, and plant fitness data. The results of the theoretical test can be generated by running the **theoretical_testing.R** script. All results in the empirical case study can be generated by running the following scripts (/Code folder) in sequence:

- **01_mutualistic_benefits_workflow.R**: This script calculates the mutualistic benefits received by plant individuals from pollinators based on plant fitness data. The empirically-estimated mutualistic benefits are used to parameterize the gamma coefficients of the interaction matrix in the next script.

- **02_dynamics_workflow.R**: This script builds all interaction matrices at the plant population and community levels and performs all analyses on the dynamics of empirical mutualistic assemblages.
